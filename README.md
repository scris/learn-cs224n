# Learn CS224N

This is the place where I store things involved in my journey learning CS224N (Winter 2023) in the summer of 2024. 

The majority of the recorded resources are in English. However, some of the resources might be in  Chinese.

## Learning Record

The scheduled learning agenda is based on [the official schedule](https://web.stanford.edu/class/archive/cs/cs224n/cs224n.1234/index.html#schedule) and [Florian Kark's self-learning schedule](https://github.com/floriankark/cs224n-win2223?tab=readme-ov-file#my-schedule). And this part is the learning record based on the agenda.
